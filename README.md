## 👋 About Me

Hey! I'm Vinicius — a former legal assistant who left the courthouse behind to dive into tech. After 5 years in the legal field, I made a bold career change, lived a transformative chapter in Dubai, and now I'm back in Brazil, fully committed to building real-world software.

I'm currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science and developing solid skills in:

- React & Next.js  
- PostgreSQL & API development  
- Docker & automated testing with Jest  
- Git version control & clean code  
- Responsive UI and problem solving

I believe in learning by building and documenting the entire journey — wins, bugs, and everything in between.
